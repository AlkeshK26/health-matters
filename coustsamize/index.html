      Body Mass Index (BMI) is a calculation that expresses the relationship
      between your height and weight as a single number.
      It's an estimate of
      body fat and a good measure of your risk for diseases that can occur with
      overweight and obesity. BMI categories are: BMI Categories Underweight:
      BMI < 18.5 Normal weight: BMI = 18.5-24.9 Overweight: BMI = 25-29.9 Obese:
      BMI ≥ 30 The BMI is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by
      your height in meters squared (kg/m2). BMI is an indicator of total body
      fat in many individuals. It is more of an indicator than a direct
      measurement of a person’s total body fat. This means that as the BMI score
      increases, so does a person’s total body fat. The WHO defines an adult who
      has a BMI between 25 and 29.9 as overweight - an adult who has a BMI of 30
      or higher is considered obese - a BMI below 18.5 is considered
      underweight, and between 18.5 to 24.9 a healthy weight.
