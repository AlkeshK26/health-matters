            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Step 1: Sit on the edge of a sturdy chair with your feet flat on
                the floor, holding onto the armrests for support if needed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Step 2: Slowly lift one leg off the floor, keeping it straight,
                and hold for a brief moment.
              </li>
              <li>
                Step 3: Lower your leg back to the starting position, keeping
                control throughout the movement.

                Step 5: As you get stronger, you can increase the difficulty by

                legs.
