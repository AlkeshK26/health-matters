            <h2>Steps and Benefits of Hammer Curl</h2>
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Step 1: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a
                dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing towards your body.
              </li>
              <li>
                Step 2: Keeping your upper arms still, bend your elbows to curl
                the dumbbells towards your shoulders, focusing on contracting
                your biceps.
              </li>
              <li>
                Step 3: Hold the dumbbells at the top of the movement for a
                brief moment, squeezing your biceps.
              </li>
              <li>
                Step 4: Lower the dumbbells back to the starting position,
                keeping control throughout the movement.
              </li>
              <li>
                Step 5: Repeat for the desired number of reps and sets,
                increasing the weight or reps as you build strength and
                endurance.
              </li>
